  <strong>Open-source tools for Rails developers who'd rather build products than boilerplate.</strong>

We believe in the power of Rails as a Single Man Framework—where one developer can ship real products without drowning in configuration, build pipelines, or infrastructure complexity. Our tools embrace the NoBuild philosophy and recognize that most successful software is, at its core, well-crafted CRUD.

## Philosophy

- **NoBuild** — Skip the bundlers, transpilers, and build steps. Ship HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that browsers already understand.
- **Single Man Framework** — Rails gives one person the leverage to build what used to require a team. Our tools amplify that.
- **CRUD is not a dirty word** — Most valuable software creates, reads, updates, and deletes data. We optimize for that reality instead of pretending otherwise.
